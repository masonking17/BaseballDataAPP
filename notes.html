<h1> MLB Data App Notes</h1>
<p>
   The information I provided seemed to be easy to read and quite informative. With clicking on each MLB team, my app shows some basic information about each team, including stadium name, city name, conference, and division within the league. The app is a way for people to learn some more information about the 30 teams in the MLB and it is extremely easy to use. I believe that I earned 30 points for my structure of information because, upon clicking on each team, the app organizes extra information for each team.

    The CSS I used gives the app an informative and interesting look from a visual standpoint. I put all of the MLB teams in a table and the extra information pops up to the right of the table. I used a picture of the San Francisco Giants stadium as the background image to tie the theme to the data. The background image also makes the app much more visually appealing than a solid color background would. Overall, I think my CSS earned somewhere around 30 points because it makes the app visually appealing and also provides an easy ability to access the data and learn more information about each team in the MLB.

   I got my data from https://erikberg.com/mlb/teams.json and it provided basic information about all 30 active teams in the MLB. This json file was difficult to find and required some lengthy searching, but it proved very resourceful and helped make my app very informative for the user.
